# VS-012: Enhanced Validation State Management

## Context

Enhance the validation state management system with advanced features for error tracking, resolution workflows, and integration with the existing history/time-travel system for complete validation state recovery.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Advanced State Tracking

- [ ] Track validation error resolution history per cell/row
- [ ] Maintain error resolution timestamps and user actions
- [ ] Store validation confidence scores and metadata
- [ ] Track validation rule version changes and impact
- [ ] Support partial validation states during processing

### AC2: Validation Workflow States

- [ ] "Under Review" state for errors being investigated
- [ ] "Acknowledged" state for errors user has seen but not fixed
- [ ] "Resolved" state for successfully corrected errors
- [ ] "Ignored" state for errors user chooses to dismiss
- [ ] Workflow transitions with proper state validation

### AC3: History Integration

- [ ] Validation state included in time-travel snapshots
- [ ] Restoration of validation metadata during undo/redo
- [ ] Validation state preserved across target shape changes
- [ ] Comprehensive state serialization for persistence
- [ ] Merge conflict resolution for concurrent validation updates

### AC4: Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Incremental validation state updates
- [ ] Lazy loading of validation metadata for large datasets
- [ ] Efficient state queries and filtering
- [ ] Memory management for long validation sessions
- [ ] Background state cleanup and optimization

## Technical Requirements

- Deep integration with existing Redux persistence system
- Efficient state serialization and deserialization
- Memory-conscious state management for large datasets
- Backward compatibility with existing validation data

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Test advanced state tracking and metadata storage
- [ ] Test workflow state transitions and validation
- [ ] Test history system integration with validation state
- [ ] Test performance with large datasets and long sessions
- [ ] Test state serialization and restoration accuracy
- [ ] Test memory management and cleanup operations
- [ ] All tests must pass: `npm run test lib/features/validation-state-management.test.ts`

## Lint Requirements

- [ ] All code must pass: `npm run lint`
- [ ] No TypeScript errors: `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Follow existing state management patterns

## Status: 📋 Planned

Advanced state management capabilities completing the validation system architecture.
