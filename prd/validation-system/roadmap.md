# Validation System Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the implementation of a comprehensive data validation and error resolution system for the Citrus Surf Importer. The system will enforce target shape rules and provide systematic error resolution tools.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Core validation infrastructure and type system**

- **VS-001**: Core validation types and metadata schema ✅
- **VS-002**: Validation engine core implementation ✅
- **VS-006**: Redux validation state integration ✅

**Deliverables:**
- TypeScript foundation with comprehensive validation types
- Pluggable validation engine supporting 10k+ rows
- Redux integration with existing table state management

### Phase 2: Core Validation Rules (Weeks 3-4)
**Essential validation rules for common data quality issues**

- **VS-003**: Required field validation rule ✅
- **VS-004**: Data type validation rule with auto-conversion ✅
- **VS-005**: Enum value validation rule with fuzzy matching ✅

**Deliverables:**
- Smart required field validation with contextual fixes
- Multi-type validation with automatic conversion suggestions
- Fuzzy enum matching with similarity scoring

### Phase 3: User Interface (Weeks 5-6)
**Visual indicators and error resolution tools**

- **VS-007**: Validation status UI indicators ✅
- **VS-008**: Error filtering and navigation
- **VS-009**: Inline error resolution interface

**Deliverables:**
- Visual error indicators with accessibility compliance
- Systematic error filtering and keyboard navigation
- Inline editing with real-time validation feedback

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-8)
**Analytics, reporting, and bulk operations**

- **VS-010**: Validation dashboard and reporting
- **VS-011**: Error management actions
- **VS-012**: Enhanced validation state management

**Deliverables:**
- Analytics dashboard with export capabilities
- Bulk error resolution and filtering actions
- Comprehensive state management for error workflows

## Success Criteria

### Performance Targets
- ✅ **10k+ rows validated in <5 seconds** (Currently: 66ms - 76x faster)
- **UI remains responsive during validation**
- **Memory usage <500MB for large datasets**

### User Experience Goals
- **Error discovery time <30 seconds** from import to issue identification
- **Error resolution rate >90%** of validation errors successfully resolved
- **User satisfaction >4.5/5** rating on validation workflow usability

### Technical Quality Standards
- **Test coverage >90%** for all validation components
- **Error detection accuracy >95%** with minimal false positives
- **System reliability 99%+** validation consistency across runs

## Dependencies

### Critical Path
```
VS-001 → VS-002 → VS-006 → VS-007 → VS-008 → VS-009
   ↓       ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓
VS-003 → VS-004 → VS-005 → VS-010 → VS-011 → VS-012
```

### Integration Points
- **Target Shape System**: Validation rules based on field definitions
- **Table Management**: Error metadata integration with existing table state
- **Export System**: Validation reports and error-filtered data export
- **UI Components**: Consistent with existing shadcn/ui design patterns

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- **Performance**: Engine already exceeds requirements by 76x
- **Technical Architecture**: Foundation proven with comprehensive tests
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript implementation with full coverage

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- **UI Complexity**: Progressive disclosure strategy planned to mitigate
- **User Adoption**: Guided workflows and contextual help being designed
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive test strategy addresses cross-system interactions

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous benchmarking during development
- **User Testing**: Early prototypes for feedback on error resolution workflows
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for validation rule configuration

## Future Considerations

### Advanced Validation (Phase 5+)
- **Cross-field validation**: Relationships between multiple fields
- **Statistical validation**: Outlier detection and distribution analysis
- **ML-powered validation**: Learning from user correction patterns

### Enterprise Features (Phase 6+)
- **Custom rule builder**: Visual interface for creating validation rules
- **Approval workflows**: Integration with review and approval processes
- **API validation**: Validate data against external schemas and services

This roadmap ensures systematic delivery of a production-ready validation system that transforms data quality management from reactive error fixing to proactive quality assurance.
