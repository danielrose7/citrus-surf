# VS-011: Error Management Actions

## Context

Implement bulk error management actions that allow users to efficiently handle validation errors at scale, including filtering to error-only views, exporting error data, and bulk dismissal of validation issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Error Filtering Actions

- [ ] "Show Only Error Rows" action that filters table to display only rows with validation errors
- [ ] "Show Only Warning Rows" action for warning-level issues
- [ ] "Show All Issues" action combining errors and warnings
- [ ] "Clear All Filters" action to restore full table view
- [ ] Filter state indicators in UI

### AC2: Error Export Actions

- [ ] "Export Error Data Only" action that downloads CSV containing only rows with validation errors
- [ ] "Export Validation Report" action generating comprehensive error summary CSV
- [ ] Include error details, suggested fixes, and metadata in exports
- [ ] Progress indicators for large dataset exports
- [ ] Export filename with timestamp and error count

### AC3: Bulk Error Management

- [ ] "Dismiss All Errors" action for bulk error acknowledgment
- [ ] "Dismiss Errors by Type" action for specific validation rule types
- [ ] "Apply Suggested Fixes" bulk action for auto-fixable errors
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs for destructive bulk operations
- [ ] Undo support for bulk actions

### AC4: Action Integration

- [ ] Actions accessible via toolbar/menu interface
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (Ctrl+Shift+E for error filter)
- [ ] Context menu actions for right-click operations
- [ ] Action state management in Redux store
- [ ] Progress feedback for long-running operations

## Technical Requirements

- Integrate with existing export utilities
- Efficient bulk operations for large datasets
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Undo/redo support through history system

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Test error-only filtering functionality
- [ ] Test CSV export of error data with proper formatting
- [ ] Test validation report export completeness
- [ ] Test bulk dismissal operations and confirmations
- [ ] Test undo functionality for bulk actions
- [ ] Test progress indicators and error handling
- [ ] All tests must pass: `npm run test components/error-management.test.tsx`

## Lint Requirements

- [ ] All code must pass: `npm run lint`
- [ ] No TypeScript errors: `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Follow existing action pattern conventions

## Status: 📋 Planned

Essential workflow actions requested by user for efficient error management at scale.
