## Why Citrus Surf?

Citrus Surf was born from a simple frustration: getting [messy] data from coworkers into a shape that can go into the database is often painful.

Not difficult, but not pleasant.

During the transformation I find myself doing things like:

- Write a VLOOKUP in spreadsheet of choice to turn labels into FKs / enum values
- Generate some slugs or UUIDs
- Convert CSV to JSON
- Escape values into SQL-friendly formats

Enter Citrus Surf!

## What's Here

- **Spreadsheet to SQL Converter** — Paste from a spreadsheet, get properly escaped SQL VALUES
- **JSON to SQL Converter** — Transform JSON arrays into INSERT or UPDATE statements
- **CSV to JSON / JSON to CSV** — Convert between the two most common data formats
- **Text Slugifier** — Turn titles and text into URL-friendly slugs
- **ID Generator** — Generate batches of UUID v4, UUID v7, or ULIDs

Each of these tools is aimed at turning a spreadsheet column into SQL VALUES and simple scripts that can be pasted into a SQL UI or terminal.

Nothing complicated. No CLI tools. No trusting a random website with your data.

Every tool on Citrus Surf runs entirely in your browser. Your data never leaves your device. There's no sign-up, no rate limits, and no cost.

Life's short. Go surfing.
